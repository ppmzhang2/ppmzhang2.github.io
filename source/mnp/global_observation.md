## Overview

Objectives:

- Quantify emission, transport, deposition, and re-emission of MnP in the marine atmosphere.
- Integrate the atmospheric pathway into the global plastic pollution cycle.
- Reduce the wide uncertainty in MnP flux estimates (currently ranging from 0.013–25 Mt/year).
- Generate reliable, policy-relevant data for regulation, environmental management, and health risk assessments.

Analytical Methods:

| Size Range   | Method                 | Purpose                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| >10 µm       | µFTIR, µRaman          | Standard polymer identification         |
| <1 µm (NP)   | AFM-IR, Raman tweezers | High-resolution nanoplastic detection   |
| All sizes    | Py-GC-MS, TD-GC-MS     | Mass-based quantification               |
| Cross-method | N.A.                   | Bridge count and mass for comparability |

## Infrastructure for Reliable Monitoring

- Standardization & Quality Assurance (QA/QC)

  - Report limits of detection ([LOD](#rec-lod)) and quantification ([LOQ](#rec-loq)).
  - Use fine particle size bins (e.g., $5 \mu m$) for better resolution.
  - Include replicates, field/lab blanks, and contamination controls.
  - Ensure 10–30% of detected particles are chemically validated (e.g., spectroscopy or thermal degradation).
  - Distinguish between aerodynamic diameter (for transport/inhalation) and physical size (for ecological impact).
  - Promote harmonized sampling and analysis protocols across studies and regions.

- Global Observation Network

- Core Network: Leverage existing stations (e.g., WMO/GAW and EMEP) at sites like Mace Head, Cape Grim, and Mauna Loa.
- Geographic Expansion:

  - Add coverage in under-sampled regions (Africa, South Asia, Pacific, Southern Oceans).
  - Deploy offshore and mobile platforms in open ocean areas.

- Sampling Platforms

  - Active samplers: High-volume air filters (e.g., Tisch HiVol).
  - Passive collectors: Devices like NILU or Petri dishes for deposition.
  - Marine samplers:
    - BIMS for sea spray and bubble-burst particle ejection.
    - MWAC for larger airborne particles.
  - Aerial samplers: UAVs for near-surface and vertical air column measurements.

- Feedback Loop (once enough long-term data is collected)

  - Identify regional hot spots, dominant transport pathways, and temporal trends.
  - Evaluate mitigation policy effectiveness.
  - Prioritize pollution source interventions (e.g., tire wear, textile fibers, marine industry).
  - Refine climate and health risk assessments using real exposure data.
