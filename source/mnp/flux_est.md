## Explanation

- Marine Ejection: emission from ocean to atmosphere (bubble burst, sea spray,
  resuspension)

- Marine Recycling: deposition from marine sources. When deposition occurs in
  the ocean, ~99% particles ejected from the sea are recycled back to the ocean.
  When deposition occurs on land, ~7% of particles ejected from the sea were on
  land.
- Land Emission: Tyre wear, brake wear, soil erosion, resuspension

- Fluvial: Riverine transport of MnP from land to ocean

{#rec-deposition}

- Deposition Mechanisms

  - Dry Deposition: Gravity-driven settling of particles directly onto surfaces.
  - Wet Deposition: Removal of particles via precipitation.
    - Nucleation scavenging (rainout): Particles incorporated into cloud droplets during cloud formation.
    - Impaction scavenging (washout): Particles captured by raindrops as they fall.
