_Figure 1. Scheme of the GLOMAP MnP representation.
In UKESM1.1, microplastics are added to GLOMAP as fragments and fibres.
Fragments enter all insoluble modes (except nucleation);
fibres only the super-coarse mode.
Fragments can age into soluble modes.
All particles undergo dry and wet deposition._

## Explanation

- Check in Terminology for definitions [modes](#rec-aerosol-mode) and
  [MnP particle types](#rec-mnp-particle-types).
- Emission: MPs are emitted directly into all insoluble modes except nucleation.
- Super-coarse insoluble mode has no pathway to soluble modes via aging.
- Aging process: Involves accumulation of soluble species (e.g., sulfate)
  forming 10+ monolayers, enabling [CCN](#rec-ccn) activation.
- Coagulation occurs across modes and alters particle size and lifetime.
- Deposition: All modes are subject to dry and wet deposition.
  - Soluble particles are more efficiently removed via wet deposition due to
    CCN activation.
- Limitations: Fibres currently modeled as spherical, which underrepresents
  their atmospheric lofting. This is a known area for future improvement.
