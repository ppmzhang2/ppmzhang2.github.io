# Faster R-CNN: Region Proposal Networks

A Region Proposal Network (RPN) takes an image and outputs a set of
object proposals.

- it is a convolutional neural network
- it takes images of any size

- The number of filters in the sliding window layer depends upon the
  backbone ($256$ for the ZF and $512$ for the VGG).
- The two parallel $1 \times 1$ convolutional layers are the core of the
  RPN \"attention\" mechanism.
- $K$ is the number of anchors. The default value is $9$
  - three scales: $128$, $256$, $512$
  - three ratios $2:1$, $1:1$, $1:2$

## Efficiency

### Computation Sharing

Both the R-CNN and the Fast R-CNN use selective search to generate
object proposals. While it is a popular region proposal method for
object detection algorithms, selective search does have its drawbacks.
One of these is that it uses a different mechanism than that of the
follow-up networks, such as the Fast R-CNN detector. This disadvantage
is overcome with the RPN:

> \... Because our ultimate goal is to share computation with a Fast
> R-CNN object detection network, we assume that both nets share a
> common set of convolutional layers \...

Essentially it means that the output of the feature extraction layer
will be utilized by both the RPN and the Fast R-CNN detector network.

### Pyramid of Anchors

The RPN has pre-defined anchors based on the size and aspect ratio, and
it simply computes features at different anchor levels. This is referred
as \"pyramid of anchors\". It allows the RPN to efficiently generate
region proposals at different scales, without the need for
computationally expensive resizing or cropping operations, as the image
/ feature pyramids design.

### Translation Invariant

If an object can be captured by a region proposal, it will be captured
anywhere in any image. The probable reason is that the anchors are
pre-defined and invariant and that the $K$ regressors are also
invariant.

## Loss Function

- Only a small portion of predictions are passed through loss
  calculation:
  - positive, which has high overlap ($\mathrm{IoU} > 0.7$) with **any**
    ground truth box, or
  - negative, which has low overlap ($\mathrm{IoU} < 0.3$) with **all**
    ground truth boxes
- It is a combination of both classification and localization risk,
  which follows the multi-task loss in Fast R-CNN:
  - classification: log loss
  - localization: smooth $L_1$[^1]. It is only activated for positive
    predictions

[^1]:
    $L_1 =
    \begin{cases} 0.5 x^2 & |x| < 1
    \\
    |x| - 0.5 & |x| \ge 1
    \end{cases}$
