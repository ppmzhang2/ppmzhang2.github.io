# Reference

## Papers

- The original paper [NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance
  Fields for View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934): it is
  the ultimate resource to understand the technique.

## Other Sources

- The post [Guide: Neural Radiance Field
  (NeRF)](https://datagen.tech/guides/synthetic-data/neural-radiance-field-nerf/)
  as a general introduction.
- Yet another general introduction [Understanding NeRF: Neural Radiance
  Fields](https://medium.com/swlh/nerf-neural-radiance-fields-79531da37734).
