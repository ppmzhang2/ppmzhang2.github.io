# Convolution: Introduction

## Interpreted by Filtering

> $f * h$ is (at least) as good as the best properties of $f$ and $h$
> separately (as long as $h$ is not a delta function)

- Filtering a signal (function) is to eliminate some of its frequency
  and let the others go through, then check the consequences in the time
  domain.
- Filter is a system that convolves an input (which can vary) with a
  fixed signal (function), a.k.a. **impulse response**
- In the frequency domain, filtering is just multiplication:
  $G = F \cdot H$
- In the time domain, filtering is synonymous with convolution:
  $g = f * h$ where $h$ is the **fixed fixed impulse response**, or the
  inverse Fourier transform of the transform function $H$.
- It is easy to understand filtering (convolution) in terms of
  frequency, not so easy in the time domain
- low-pass filter works as a smoother: removing the short-term
  fluctuations and leaving the longer-term trend.
- high-pass filter: e.g. edge detection
- To design a filter is to design $H$

## Differentiability

If $f$ is differentiable, convolution $f * g$ is differentiable:

$$(f * g)' = f' * g$$
